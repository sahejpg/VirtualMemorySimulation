# Virtual Memory Simulation Project

## Overview
In this project, I implemented crucial components of a virtual memory system simulator, which has deepened my understanding of virtual memory concepts, including page replacement algorithms and memory management.

## My Contributions
Here are the key contributions I've made to this project:

- **va_splitting.h:** I developed va_splitting.h to efficiently break down virtual addresses, ensuring a smooth virtual memory operation.

- **mmu.c Enhancement:** I enhanced mmu.c to maintain robust system and memory access bookkeeping, guaranteeing efficient memory management.

- **proc.c Refinement:** I refined proc.c for improved process-related bookkeeping, ensuring seamless process execution.

- **Customized page_fault.c:** I customized page_fault.c to optimize the page fault handler process, reducing system downtime.

- **Advanced Algorithms and Statistics:** I integrated advanced algorithms and statistics for memory management, enhancing overall system performance.
